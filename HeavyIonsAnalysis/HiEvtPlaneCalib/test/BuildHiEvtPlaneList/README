The BuildHiEvtPlaneList program takes a .csv file that defines the
desired event planes and generates the HiEvtPlaneList.h header file used in
CMSSW.  It is expected that the .csv file will be
generated using a spreadsheet program such as Excel or Numbers. 
To use the modified event plane list it is necessary to
check out RecoHI/HiEvtPlaneAlgos and replace the HiEvtPlaneList.h file located
in the interface directory with the one generated here.  The column 
definitions in the .csv file are as follows:

Index     - Sequential index, starting with 0
Name      - Name of event plane.  An enum is generated with this name.
Detector  - Detector subcomponent used for EP:  HF/Tracker/RPD/Castor
Order     - Harmonic order of the EP
hmin1     - Pseudorapidity range hmin1 < eta < hmax1
hmax1
hmin2
hmax2     - Add pseudorapidity range  hmin2 < eta < hmax2 
minpt     - pt range (Tracker) or et range (HF, RPD, Castor) minpt to maxpt  
maxpt
nsub      - Determine EP resolution using 2 (2sub) or 3 (3sub)  subevents
mcw       - Flag for applying momentum conserving weight (1st order, only)
rmate1    - EP used for EP resolution (2sub and 3sub)
rmate2    - Additional EP used for EP resolution (3sub)

A hardcoded limit of 50 event planes exists. 
To define more than 50 event planes  it is necessary to modify 
CondFormats/HIObjects/interface/RPFlatParams.h.  
(All occurrences of 50 need to be changed to the desired maximum number
of event planes.)
